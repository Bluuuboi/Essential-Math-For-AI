# Essential-Math-For-AI
This repository contains the supplementary material associated with my book: Essential Math for AI published by O'Reilly Media

Since the book is not about developing AI models, these few Python files reproduce images that I created for the book. 
They are nevertheless helpful for beginners and for readers who never wrote any code before.
I will keep reviewing as often as time allows to make sure that the code is up to date. 
Meanwhile, watch out for my new book, which focuses solely on computation, modeling, coding, AI algorithms, information and more!
